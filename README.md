Today, I'm creating a repository to showcase my data analysis journey.
I'm a BI Analyst proficient in Advanced Excel, Power Query, SQL, and Python for data analysis.
While I'm more fluent in AWS QuickSight for data visualization, I also have working knowledge of:
Power BI, Tableau and Python libraries - Seaborn and Matplotlib.
